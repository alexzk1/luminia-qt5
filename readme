README
======

Thanks for testing Lumina.

Install
=======

Lumina requires QT-4.3.2

"qmake && make && doxygen"

for compiling and generating the documentation.

Glew is now included, so a a QT installation with compiler should be 
enough.

Doxygen is used to generate the XML documentation that can be
parsed by Lumina. If it's not build the script reference won't
work.

It is important, that luminas working directory is the the lumina
base directory, elsewhere the scripts won't work.

It's recommend to start the program from a shell to see the
debugging messages and shader compiler outputs. Shader compiler
errors will be reported with popups.


Documantation and Tutorial
==========================

Look at the project website for documentation and tutorials.
http://lumina.sourceforge.net/
(included in this package in the doc subdirectory)
The media directory contains some shaders, textures and scripts.
Some lum files are located in the root directory. This are
examples, but some of them needs addition files.

IRC Client
==========

This version of Lumina includes a very simple IRC client, it can be
used for feed back, bug reports, sugestions and to chat with other
lumina users. The default chanel is #lumina on irc.freenode.net.
(If the IRC Button is nor visible, check the working directory)

Importer
========

Currently are importer available for OBJ, 3DS, X, MD2 and MD3:

OBJ:
Should be abli to import all files

3DS:
only Position and Texcoords, normals can be generated with
a normal generator but smothing groups are ignored.

X:
The current version merge al meshes of a frame into a single lumina
mesh and creates one index per material.

MD2:
This format can be imported without data loss (except the frame names).
A simple script and vertex shader are required, to handle the keyframe
interpolation.

MD3:
This format is used by Quake 3 to store Model parts. The Tags are stored
into buffer objects, so it may be possible to animated quake3 models,
with a script and vertexshader too (currently not tested)

CMF:
Importing of cal3d binary mesh files is supported in Lumina 0.3.0-r2.
Each material will has it's own index. Limitations are  only the first 
set of UVCoords will be imported and a maximum of 4 influences per vertex.
Springs are not supported jet.

CR2:
Currently only a parser. Currently not enough documantation about the
blending zones available.

Generators
==========

Normal generator:
Only a mesh with vertex positions and indices is required. Generates 
interpolated normals

Tangent generator:
Creates Tangents requires ; Vertex position, Normal, and texcoords.

Texturespace Quaternion:
requires Normal and Tangent. It can be used to quaternion based
bumpmapping, that can be combined with BRDFs.

Known Bugs:
===========



Differences to common naming conventions :
==========================================
Many script functions starts with capital letters, they can be allways
used in scripts. Function names with small letters are used for propertys,
internal Signal and Slots and editing. Sometimes they could be used in scripts,
but they may be not avaible in a future framework, that can use the Lumina files.
The OpenGL prefixes are "gl" and "GL_" replaced by "gl."

Blenderexporter
===============

The blender exporter should be moved/copied/linked in blenders script
directory.
It exports a selected meshes as *.lum file.
