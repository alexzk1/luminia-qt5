README
------

This exporter for Blender exports meshes to lumina files.
Put it in your Blender script directory.
All quads will be converted into triangles.
To export a model mark all needed objects and select the exporter
 from the export menu.

Position and Normal

Both will be exported every time.


UVcoords, Tangend and TexSpace quaternion

All will be exported/generated if UVCoords are present. Tangent is the
Tangendvector that is needed for many bumpmapping algorithms. 
The TexSpace quaternion is a quaternion that is generated from 
a TBN Matrix. It's usefull for quaternion based bumpmapping.

Bonedepencys

Will be exported if a mesh has a armature as parent. 
The Bone number is added to the weight (range 0.0 - 0.9999)

RelToJoint
An alternate position relative to joints. Usefull for quaternion based
Bonesystems. Only created with bones.

Softbody (experimental)

Softinit1 and Softinit2 are the edges connected neighbor vertexnumbers.
(maximum 8 connections)
Softbody is a new and experimental read the exporter code
